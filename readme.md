# Parallax theme
_for WonderCMS 2.x.x_

This is just a test of mine. Use at your own risk. Works best with a floating summernote editor.

Demo: https://www.wonder.stanisic.nl

## How to install

1. Login to your website.
1. Go to Settings >> Themes & Plugins.
1. Select `Theme` and paste the following url in the input field:
   ```https://github.com/StephanStanisic/theme-parallax/releases/download/0.0.1/theme-parallax.zip```
1. Enable the theme in the General section. 

## Sample data

The sample-database.js contains the same HTML from the demo website. Uses /loginURL as login url and 'admin' as password.

## Features

The theme adds a parallax header to each page. You can edit the title and subtitle in the header just by clicking on it.
This works the best with the summernote plugin, but as a floating editor. (fork of plugin coming soon)

You can set a background by uploding a file using the page title as the filename. Any extention works, but I reccomend using jpeg files.

Example:

home.jpg gets used as the homepage background
home.png gets used as the homepage background
example.webp gets used as the background for the page `/example`
